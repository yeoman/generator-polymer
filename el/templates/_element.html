  This template contains a very detailed description about how we can use Polymer to build better WebApps. The
  descriptions are an approach to give people a very clean overview of how they can use Polymer.

  The most text and content is extracted/based on from https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/polymer/polymer.html
  (licensed under CC BY 3.0.).

  The attribute 'attributes' is used to publish attributes and declare a public API for the consumers of this element.
    -> https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/polymer/polymer.html#published-properties

  If the 'extends' attribute is used, then this element extends from the existing element.
    -> https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/polymer/polymer.html#extending-other-elements

  If 'noscript' is set, the Custom Element doesn't have any scripts inside and Polymer() don't need to be called.
    -> https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/polymer/polymer.html#altregistration

  Default attributes like class="active" or 'mycustomattr' can be given. They will be included on each instance of the
  element.

  Summary:
    - name        (required)    Name for the custom element. Requires a "-".
    - attributes                Used to publish properties.
    - extends                   Used to extend other elements.
    - noscript                  For simple elements that don't need to call Polymer(). See Element registration.
    - constructor               The name of the constructor to put on the global object. Allows users to create
                                instances of your element using the new operator (e.g. var tagName = new TagName()).

        // Custom property observers - 'observe blocks'
        //
        //   An observe block defines a custom property/observer mapping for
        //   one or more properties. It can be used to watch for changes to
        //   nested objects or share the same callback for several properties.
        observe: {
          // for these properties, Polymer DOES NOT CALL the *propertyName*Changed
          // callback, instead the defined observer gets called.

        observe: {
          // this will search within the <template> for an element with id="foo" and watches
          // for the attribute 'someProperty' to change.
          '$.foo.someProperty': 'fooPropertyChanged',

          // even nested object path
          'a.b.c': 'validateSubPath'
        },

        fooPropertyChanged: function(oldValue, newValue) {
          // ...
        },

        validateSubPath: function(oldValue, newValue) {
          // here we can use the Polymer helper to get the value of the nested path
          var value = Path.get('a.b.c').getValueFrom(this);

          // oldValue == undefined, if the value was not declaratively set in the HTML markup
          // newValue == value == this.a.b.c
        },

        // if a property is defined in an 'observe block', the defined method will be
        // called - even if the property is defined within the object.
        bar: '',
        observe: {
          bar: 'validate'
        },
        barChanged: function(oldValue, newValue) {
          console.log("I'm not called");
        },
        validate: function(oldValue, newValue) {
          console.log("I'm called instead");
        },

        // ***** Automatic node finding *****
        // Another useful feature of Polymer is automatic node finding. Nodes in a component’s
        // shadow DOM that are tagged with an id attribute are automatically referenced in the
        // component’s this.$ hash.
        //
        // NOTE: Nodes created dynamically using data binding are not added to the this.$ hash
        // The hash includes only statically created shadow DOM nodes (that is, the nodes
        // defined in the element’s outermost template).
        //
        // <template>
        //   <input type="text" id="nameInput">
        // </template>
        //
        logNameValue: function() {
          console.log(this.$.nameInput.value);
        },

        // but also not IDed elements can be grabbed with querySelector:
        // <template>
        //  <div id="container">
        //    <template if="{{some_condition}}">
        //      <div id="inner">
        //        This content is created by data binding.
        //      </div>
        //    </template>
        //    </div>
        // </template>
        //
        // locateable via -> this.$.container.querySelector('#inner');
        // or             -> this.shadowRoot.querySelector('#inner')

        // ***** Custom Events *****
        // Polymer provides fire() which is a wrapper around the standard node.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent(...))
        // When a microtask has ended is sometimes better to use asyncFire(), which is asynchronous.
        //
        // <template>
        //   <button on-click="{{onClick}}">Send hurt</button>
        // </template>
        //
        // You can use
        //
        // document.querySelector('my-element-having-the-above-template').addEventListener('ouch', function() {
        //   console.log(e.type, e.detail.msg); // "ouch" "That hurt!"
        // });
        //
        // which can be simplified to:
        // <my-element-having-the-above-template on-ouch="{{myMethod}}"></my-element-having-the-above-template>
        onClick: function() {
          this.fire('ouch', {msg: 'That hurt!'}); // fire(type, detail, targetNode, bubbles?, cancelable?)
        }
      });

    })();

<!-- ***** Extending other elements ***** -->

    You are {{praise}} <content></content>!
  </template>

    Polymer({

    });

         element's shadow dom here. -->

<!-- overriding a parent's methods -->

<!--
  When you override an inherited method, you can call the parent’s
  method with
  this.super(), and optionally pass it a list of arguments (e.g.
  this.super([arg1, arg2])). The reason the parameter is an array is so you can write
  this.super(arguments).
-->

<!--
  In this example, when the user clicks on a <polymer-cooler> element, its makeCoolest()
  method is called, which in turn calls the parent’s version using this.super(). The
  praise property (inherited from <polymer-cool>) is set to “coolest”.
-->
<polymer-element name="polymer-cool">
  <template>
    You are {{praise}} <content></content>!
  </template>
  <script>
    Polymer({
      praise: 'cool',
      makeCoolest: function() {
        this.praise = 'the coolest';
      }
    });
  </script>
</polymer-element>

<polymer-element name="polymer-cooler" extends="polymer-cool"
                 on-click="{{makeCoolest}}">
  <template>
    <shadow></shadow>
  </template>
  <script>
    Polymer({
      praise: 'cool',
      makeCoolest: function() {
        this.super(); // calls polymer-cool's makeCoolest()
      }
    });
  </script>
</polymer-element>

<polymer-cooler>Matt</polymer-cooler>

<!-- ***** Built-in element methods ***** -->
<!-- Polymer includes a few handy methods on your element’s prototype. -->

<!--
  To know when light DOM children change, you can setup a Mutation Observer to be notified
  when nodes are added or removed. To make this more convenient, Polymer adds an onMutation()
  callback to every element. Its first argument is the DOM element to observe. The second
  argument is a callback which is passed the MutationObserver and the mutation records:

  this.onMutation(domElement, someCallback);

  Example - Observe changes to (light DOM) children elements:

  ready: function() {
    // Observe a single add/remove.
    this.onMutation(this, this.childrenUpdated);
  },
  childrenUpdated: function(observer, mutations) {
    // getDistributedNodes() has new stuff.

    // Monitor again.
    this.onMutation(this, this.childrenUpdated);
  }
-->

<!-- ***** Dealing with asynchronous tasks ***** -->
<!--
  Many things in Polymer happen asynchronously. Changes are gathered up and executed all at once,
  instead of executing right away. Batching changes creates an optimization that (a) prevents
  duplicated work and (b) reduces unwanted FOUC.

  Change watchers and situations that rely on data-bindings are examples that fit under this async
  behavior. For example, conditional templates may not immediately render after setting properties
  because changes to those renderings are saved up and performed all at once after you return from
  JavaScript.

  To do work after changes have been processed, Polymer provides async(). It’s similar to window.setTimeout(),
  but it automatically binds this to the correct value and is timed to requestAnimationFrame:

  // async(inMethod, inArgs, inTimeout)
  this.async(function() {
    this.foo = 3;
  }, null, 1000);

  // Roughly equivalent to:
  //setTimeout(function() {
  //  this.foo = 3;
  //}.bind(this), 1000);

  The first argument is a function or string name for the method to call asynchronously. The second argument,
  inArgs, is an optional object or array of arguments to pass to the callback.

  In the case of property changes that result in DOM modifications, follow this pattern:
-->
<script>
    Polymer('my-element', {
      propChanged: function() {
        // If "prop" changing results in our DOM changing,
        // schedule an update after the new microtask.
        this.async(this.updateValues);
      },
      updateValues: function() {
        // ...
      }
    });
</script>

<!-- ***** Delaying work ***** -->
<!--
  Sometimes it’s useful to delay a task after an event, property change, or user interaction. A common
  way to do this is with window.setTimeout():

  this.responseChanged = function() {
    if (this.timeout1) {
      clearTimeout(this.toastTimeout1);
    }
    this.timeout1 = window.setTimeout(function() {
      ...
    }, 500);
  }

  However, this is such a common pattern that Polymer provides the job() utility for doing the same thing:

  this.responseChanged = function() {
    this.job('job1', function() { // first arg is the name of the "job"
      this.fire('done');
    }, 500);
  }

  job() can be called repeatedly before the timeout but it only results in a single side-effect. In other
  words, if responseChanged() is immediately executed 250ms later, the done event won’t fire until 750ms.
-->

<!-- ***** Advanced topics ***** -->
<!--
  1) Life of an element’s bindings

  When you remove an element from the DOM, Polymer asynchronously deactivates its {{}} bindings and *Changed
  methods. This helps prevent memory leaks, ensuring the element will be garbage collected.

  If you want the element to “remain active” when it’s not in the document, call cancelUnbindAll() right after
  you remove it. The lifecycle methods are a good place for this:

  Polymer('my-element', {
    detached: function() {
      // Keep bindings active when this element is removed
      this.cancelUnbindAll();
    }
  });



  2) How data changes are propagated

  Data changes in Polymer happen almost immediately (at end of a microtask) when Object.observe() is available.
  When it’s not supported, Polymer uses a polyfill (observe-js) to poll and periodically propagate data-changes
  throughout the system. This is done through a method called Platform.flush().

  What is Platform.flush()?

  Platform.flush() is part of Polymer’s data observation polyfill, observe-js. It dirty check’s all objects that
  have been observed and ensures notification callbacks are dispatched. Polymer automatically calls Platform.flush()
  periodically, and this should be sufficient for most application workflows. However, there are times when you’ll
  want to call Platform.flush() in application code.

  Note: on platforms that support Object.observe() natively, Platform.flush() does nothing.

  When should I call Platform.flush()?

  Instead of waiting for the next poll interval, one can manually schedule an update by calling Platform.flush().
  There are very few cases where you need to call Platform.flush() directly.

  If it’s important that a data change propagates before the next screen paint, you may need to manually call
  Platform.flush(). Here are specific examples:

  a) A property change results in a CSS class being added to a node. Often, this works out fine, but sometimes,
     it’s important to make sure the node does not display without the styling from the added class applied to it.
     To ensure this, call Platform.flush() in the property change handler after adding the CSS class.

  b) The author of a slider element wants to ensure that data can propagate from it as the user slides the slider.
     A user of the element, might, for example, bind the slider’s value to an input and expect to see the input
     change while the slider is moving. To achieve this, the element author calls Platform.flush() after setting
     the element’s value in the ontrack event handler.

  Note: Polymer is designed such that change notifications are asynchronous. Both Platform.flush() and Object.observe()
  (after which it’s modeled) are asynchronous. Therefore, Platform.flush() should not be used to try to enforce
  synchronous data notifications. Instead, always use change watchers to be informed about state.



  3) How Polymer elements prepare themselves

  For performance reasons, <polymer-element>s avoid the expense of preparing ShadowDOM, event listeners, and property
  observers if they’re created outside the main document. This behavior is similar to how native elements such as
  <img> and <video> behave. They remain in a semi-inert state when created outside the main document (e.g. an <img>
  avoids the expense of loading its src).

  Polymer elements prepare themselves automatically in the following cases:

  a) when they’re created in a document that has a defaultView (the main document)
  b) when they receive the attached callback
  c) when they’re created in the shadowRoot of another element that is preparing itself

  In addition, if the .alwaysPrepare property is set to true, Polymer elements prepare themselves even when they
  do not satisfy the above rules.

  Polymer('my-element', {
    alwaysPrepare: true
  });

  Note: an element’s ready() lifecycle callback is called after an element has been prepared. Use ready() to know when
  an element is done initializing itself.
-->

<!-- ***** Resolving paths of sibling elements ***** -->
<!--
  For the general case of element re-use and sharing, URLs in HTML Imports are meant to be relative to the location of
  the import. The majority of the time, the browser takes care of this for you.

  However, JavaScript doesn’t have a notion of a local import. Therefore, Polymer provides a resolvePath() utility for
  converting paths relative to the import to paths relative to the document.

  For example: If you know your import is in a folder containing a resource (e.g x-foo.png), you can get a path to
  x-foo.png which will work relative to the main document by calling this.resolvePath('x-foo.png').

  Visually, this might look like the following:

  index.html
  components/x-foo/
    x-foo.html
    x-foo.png

  At an element level, where this refers to an instance of an x-foo created by index.html,
  this.resolvePath('x-foo.png') === 'components/x-foo/x-foo.png'.
-->
